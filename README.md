This project harnesses the power of Databricks to delve into app trends on the Google Play Store. We strategically combine the precision of SQL queries with the robust capabilities of Python and PySpark. The initial phase involves crafting an SQL query to extract pertinent information from your Play Store data. This query hones in on capturing crucial details like app names, developer information, and release dates. Subsequently, Python takes the reins. We transform the retrieved data into a PySpark DataFrame, a versatile structure designed for distributed processing. By wielding PySpark's groupBy and count functions, we meticulously aggregate app downloads or installations (depending on your data) for each unique combination of developer and release year. This meticulous process culminates in a PySpark DataFrame that illuminates app release patterns across different years. To identify trending apps, we meticulously define a methodology. This methodology could encompass various techniques, such as ranking apps by yearly download/install count, calculating the change in downloads/installs compared to previous years, or even incorporating external data sources like user reviews for a more comprehensive analysis. Finally, we can leverage data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to transform the results into compelling charts. These visualizations effectively communicate the number of apps released by each developer per year and highlight the trending apps for each period. Through this insightful analysis, we gain valuable insights into app developer trends over time, potentially enabling us to predict the next wave of popular apps on the Google Play Store.
